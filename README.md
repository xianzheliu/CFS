#CFS
---
All of my days, I always keep a thought in my mind. Could I made Build a Compiler from scratch.
So from now on, I finally make up my mind to start this project. Maybe it's just a toy compiler,
but means the first step for myself. Also, I hope if anyone interest in CFS, welcome  to commit 
your code. Anywhere you find a potential bug, show no mercy about it, just point it out!
